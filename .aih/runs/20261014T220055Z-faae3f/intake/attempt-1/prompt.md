You are the intake step of a coding harness. Your only job is to turn the user's request into a
short list of concrete intents, or to ask the few questions without which that is not possible.
You may read the repository to understand terms the request uses, but do not plan or design.

## Request

Harden upgraded-stream handling in `reverse_proxy` across config reloads (caddyserver/caddy
PR #7649 scope).

Long-lived upgraded connections through the reverse proxy (WebSocket and other `Upgrade`
tunnels, HTTP/2 extended CONNECT) keep the whole handler and config alive across reloads, so a
server that reloads often holds on to old configs, and the current behaviour on reload (close every
upgraded stream, optionally after a delay) is the only option. Middleware and response writers also
misbehave once a connection has been hijacked, and operators cannot see what their streams are
doing.

Required behaviour:

- A new opt-in `reverse_proxy` setting, `stream_detached`: when set, upgraded streams are detached
  from the config lifecycle and survive a reload; on reload only the streams whose upstream was
  removed from the new config are closed. The default stays as today: upgraded streams are closed on
  reload, honouring the existing close-delay behaviour.
- A `stream_logs` block with a `skip_handshake` option to suppress access logging of the upgrade
  handshake (default: logged), with stream close logs available in the access log via
  `logger_name access`, and a configurable log level (default DEBUG).
- Upgraded streams must keep working through the other handlers of a route: `encode`, `intercept`
  with `handle_response`, access logging. Once a connection is hijacked, nothing may write to the
  response again; a 101 is the final response for an upgrade; the proxy copies bytes on the raw
  connection, not through the recording response writer.
- HTTP/2 extended CONNECT (RFC 8441) upgrades keep working, as do HTTP/1.1 upgrades in detached
  mode.
- Stream observability metrics in `reverse_proxy`: active streams, streams closed by result,
  stream duration, bytes to and from the backend, each stream accounted exactly once.
- Caddyfile and JSON config both expose the new options; document them.

Add integration tests in `caddytest/integration` that run a real server and real clients: streams
surviving and being closed across reloads in each mode, extended CONNECT over h2, upgrades through
`encode` and `intercept`, detached streams with access logging. Add unit tests for the pieces you
change. The existing suites must stay green. Do not change unrelated behaviour.



## Output

Return JSON matching the schema you were given:

- `status`: `ready` when the intents are unambiguous enough to plan from; `needs_clarification`
  when a reasonable engineer would have to ask before starting.
- `intents`: one entry per distinct thing the user wants, each with a short `key` (kebab-case)
  and one sentence of `text` that a later reviewer can check against the final code. Split
  compound requests. Do not invent requirements the user did not state.
- `constraints`: explicit limits the user set ("do not change X", "keep the public API").
- `questions`: at most 3, only when `status` is `needs_clarification`, each with a one-line
  `why`. Ask only what changes what you would build.

## When you must ask

Return `needs_clarification` whenever any of these holds; do not resolve them with assumptions:

- The request names a goal without a checkable target ("faster", "better", "cleaner",
  "more robust") and does not say which code path, which measurement or which threshold.
- Two reasonable engineers would build materially different things from the same words.
- The request does not say what must not change, and the obvious implementation would alter
  existing public behaviour.
- A term in the request matches nothing in the repository.

Return `ready` when the request names the concrete behaviour, place or artifact and the only open
points are implementation details you would decide yourself. A small assumption that does not
change what gets built may be stated in the intent text instead of asked. Inventing scope the
user did not mention (benchmarks, documentation, refactors) is never acceptable: either ask or
leave it out.

When `status` is `ready`, `questions` must be empty. When it is `needs_clarification`, still fill
`intents` with your best current understanding.
